1) We have compiled the best known Pareto sets for each one of the 110 Taillard test instances used (available in http://soa.iti.es/problem-instances). These best known sets are given by the algortihms MEDA/D-MK and MOEA/D, different parameters settings and maximum number of generations.

The file 'best-known-cmax-tft.tar.gz' is the best known results for the objectives Makespan and Total Flowtime

The file 'best-known-cmax-tard.tar.gz' is the best known results for the objectives Makespan and Total Tardiness

The file 'best-known-cmax-tft-tard.tar.gz' is the best known results for the objectives Makespan, Total Flowtime and Total Tardiness

2) Supplentary Document:

The document supplementaryResults.pdf includes additional tables and analysis of the results obtained for Makespan and Total Flowtime such as average Hypervolume and CPU time.
