# suplementaymaterialforMoPFSP
This folder contains the supplementary material for the paper entitled: Multiobjective Decomposition-based Mallows Models Estimation of Distribution Algorithm. A case of study for Permutation Flowshop Scheduling Problem

Authors: Murilo Zangari, Aurora Pozo (Federal University of Paran√°), Roberto Santama and Alexander Mendiburu (University of Basque Country)

1) We have compiled the best known Pareto sets for each instance one of the 110 Taillard test instances (from http://soa.iti.es/problem-instances). These sets are given by the algortihms MEDA/D-MK and MOEA/D, different parameters settings and generations.

The file 'best-known-cmax-tft.tar.gz' is the best known results for the bi-objective Makespan and Total Flowtime

The file 'best-known-cmax-tard.tar.gz' is the best known results for the bi-objective Makespan and Total Tardiness

The file 'best-known-cmax-tft-tard.tar.gz' is the best known results for the tree-objective Makespan, Total Flowtime and Total Tardiness

2) Supplentary Document:

The document supplementaryResults.pdf includes additional tables and analysis of the results obtained for Makespan and Total Flowtime such as average Hypervolume and CPU time.
