1) Best known approximated Pareto fronts:

We have conducetd an experimental study using the 110 Taillard test instances (The benchmark is available in http://soa.iti.es/problem-instances). 

We have compiled our best known aproximated Pareto fronts by the union of the sets produced by the algortihms MEDA/D-MK and MOEA/D, several runs, and different parameter settings.

The file 'best-known-cmax-tft.tar.gz' contain our 110 best known sets optimizing the Makespan and Total Flowtime

2) Supplentary Document:

The document 'supplementaryResults.pdf' includes additional tables and analysis of the results obtained for Makespan and Total Flowtime such as the average Hypervolume and CPU time.
